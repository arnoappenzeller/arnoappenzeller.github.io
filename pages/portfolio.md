# Research
I worked on different research projects in the Digital Health domain.
My research focuses on privacy and security for personal data.
I investigated the fields of GDPR-compliant consent management and the application of privacy preserving technologies like Differential Privacy.

Here is an example architecture for privacy preserving data donations from my research:

My whole research topics were combined in my PhD thesis to a prototypical system:
![Prototypical System](/img/architektur_prototyp.pdf "Prototypical System") 

We also investigated the feasibility of different synthetic data generators and there specific privacy and usability:

(See the full paper [here](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/23/12320))

My German PhD thesis is published [online](https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000171248).
You can find most of the publications I collaborated on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=z4YjITgAAAAJ&hl=de).



# Software/App Development

## Apple Plattform
I create apps for Apple plattforms since 2012.
You can see my currently available apps in the AppStore [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/id515339331).
Some apps reached there end of support and are not available anymore.

My most popular apps are:

* [PiPifier](https://itunes.apple.com/app/pipifier-pip-for-every-web-video/id1234771095?mt=8): A Safari extension for macOS and iOS that enables Picture in Picture mode on every video on the web. This app uses JS and Swift technologies. It is also [open source](https://github.com/arnoappenzeller/PiPifier) (However, I am a bit behind maintaining the repository)
![PiPifier_Demo_iOS](/img/pipifier_ios_usage.gif "Demo iOS")

* [µBrowser](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/µbrowser/id1590622755): µBrowser was the first standalone web browser for Apple Watch. It was featured by Apple in US App Store and on the watchOS App Store.

I created apps for every current Apple plattform in Objective-C, Swift, AppKit, UIKit, and SwiftUI. I am very eager to learn more about existing and new technologies

## Other projects
I worked on several work and hobby projects where I used various different technologies.
I like to use Python for any kind of quick script or data analyses using Jupyter.
I am also familiar with web technologies like ReactJS and deployment of web apps using container technologies like Docker.
In general, I am very quick learner in every kind of programming language and technology.
