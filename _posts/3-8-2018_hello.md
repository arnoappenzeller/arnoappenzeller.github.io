Since I heard there will be .app domains I was excited to get one. I always thought about a fancy short domain for a personal website: arnoarnoappzeller.com? - too long, arno.com? - taken, of course.

So arno.app was perfect for me. My name is Arno Appenzeller so it's part of my full name. I'm a app developer so the .app is good fit too.
I bought the domain and here we are. I hope to fill this page with some more interesting technical and personal posts. Also you can learn more about me in the About Me section and you can have a look at some of my work in Portfolio.
